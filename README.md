# JDK Mission Control copr

### Motivation
The purpose of this repo is to provide Fedora users with a method of easily installing and using JDK Mission Control (JMC). The current methodology includes packaging JMC binaries produced by AdoptOpenJDK, and hosting them on my copr page: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/almac/

Special thanks to the AdoptOpenJDK team for providing easy access to builds of JMC. Please find below a list of releases currently supported in copr, and where to find the sources used to package them.
